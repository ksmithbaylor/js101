# CommonJS Modules

This is a simple example of how modules can depend on each other in JavaScript.
If you run `node index.js`, you can trace how the dependencies are imported and
run.

REMEMBER: this is not available in the browser! Node.js supports the `require`
syntax, but if you want to use modules in the browser you need a tool like
`webpack` or `browserify`.
