# Node.js Basics

These examples cover what we did in class concerning Node.

# Instructions

To get started, you need to install the dependencies from npm:

    $ npm install

(Note: this is a command you should run from the terminal, in the same directory
as this file. You don't type the `$`, it's just there to indicate that this is
a terminal command.)

Then, to run a file, just run `node <filename>`.
